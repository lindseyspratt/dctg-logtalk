# dctg-logtalk
# Definite Clause Translation Grammar

The major predicates are `dctg_process` and `dctg_consult`, which consults a file of DCTG rules.

## History
This Logtalk implementation of the Definite Clause Translation Grammar is based on an implementation created by Lindsey Spratt in December, 1986, which in turn was based on "Definite Clause Translation Grammars" by Harvey Abramson in Proceedings of the Logic Programming Symposium, IEEE, Atlantic City, New Jersey, February 1984.

In Abramson's implementation, `dctg_process` is called `translate_rule`.
